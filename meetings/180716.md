## Questions/Comments for the development process:

- Some courses may require the review of a consultant, either during or after the development process. This role may be to help the main developer shape the course (planning), find resources, review the units, complete an instructor's manual, etc.  This second expert opinion is a great benefit to the course development process.
- Is there a plan for adding media resources for courses? SME videos or expert interviews would increase the quality of our courses, but they need the proper equipment/resources.  Perhaps a goal/request for 2019?
