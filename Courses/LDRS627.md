## COURSE DESCRIPTION

Introduction to principles and practices of adult education. Focusing on facilitation methods and instructional design, this course develops practical skills necessary to teach adults. Whether in a classroom, other formal learning context or workplace, leaders are all teachers. This course equips leaders to facilitate transformational learning experiences that are learner-centered, supportive, well-organized and based on critical inquiry in the context of practice.

## COURSE LEARNING OUTCOMES

On successfully completing this course, students should be able to:

1. Develop service-oriented leadership insight, skills, and values that promote a framework for successful adult learning and achievement.
2. Articulate a justified, worldview-based vision for adult learning.
3. Categorize and appraise various approaches to adult learning.
4. Assess the strengths and weaknesses of various approaches to adult learning.
5. Categorize and appraise various approaches to adult learning assessment.
6. Based on your synthesis of perspectives, themes and ideas design one lesson or session that will be useful to you in your work.

#### LDRS Reading Response Rubric

#### 8-10

* Reader identifies information from the assigned reading that resonates or strikes them in a personal way and clearly explains the reason for their choices.

### ~~Forum Discussions~~ Blog Posts 20%

* Online group discussions in this class are meant to be conversational though APA references for anything ‘borrowed’ is still expected.
* PARTICIPATION: Each week you are required to post a reflection \(of about 3 to 4 paragraphs with references following\) to a given prompt and then, make several substantive written reply posts to others’ reflections and/or replies.
* ~~THREADING: Be careful to thread your messages properly. Please begin your post with a colleague’s name where applicable. Post below the subject to which you are responding and have the subject line accurately reflect the post. If there is not a thread up at the time you would like to post, initiate a new thread and then post below it.~~
* CONFIDENTIALITY: Part of the value and richness of course dialogue is that learners share from their life/professional experiences to illustrate lessons they have learned. Please share discreetly and use pseudonyms when possible and necessary. Please do not share any confidential or proprietary information about your employer.
* SUBSTANTIVE PARTICIPATION: We have a great opportunity to build upon one another’s knowledge, insights, and experience. Our goal is to be collaborative in the blogs. At times we will respectfully challenge each other. We anticipate that this will be a rich time of dialogue. To create a safe environment for this to take place, we must build a supportive subculture that encourages one another. Disagreeing and challenging can be stimulating if done in an edifying manner.

##### Substantive participation/posting may include:

* Providing a new thought, idea, or perspective;
* Citing an experience or example of what we are learning;
* Adding a new twist on a perspective;
* Critically thinking about an idea/concept;
* Questioning or challenging a principle/perspective.

##### What Substantive Participation is NOT:

* Very basic comments such as “I agree” or “I disagree;”
* Restating what has been said \(unless there is a direct purpose in doing so\);
* Disrespectfully disagreeing;
* Pat answers that are not thought-provoking or do not move the dialogue forward;
* ~~Greetings/conversation better suited for the Virtual Collegium.~~

##### Below are examples of how to stimulate your own and others’ thinking:

* What would happen if...
* Other times it may be helpful to...
* It is my understanding...what is your experience with this?
* You might approach this from...
* Is it possible that...
* Would you consider...
* Maybe...
* Possibly...
* Sometimes...
* I'm wondering if...
* Do you think...

#### Evaluation Rubric:

* The original posting is of high quality, showing depth of knowledge on the topic.  The post ends with an open-ended question to advance the discussion.  
* Replies occur under two or more different threads, other than that belonging to the student. Replies are posted on more than one day during the posting period.  
* Response posts to peers' original postings are respectful, show clear synthesis and evaluation of the content read, and provide depth, breath, or new insight to the topic. Reply posts stimulate thinking and advance the conversation.  
* As appropriate, references are included to support what is said in both original and reply posts.  
* All posts are clearly written and contain no ~~APA~~/spelling/grammatical errors.  That said, a conversational tone, rather than an approach you would take in an academic paper, is perfectly fine.

##### 4% biweekly

* 4 = outstanding depth of response; always includes a question to advance the discussion, appropriately referenced following APA, no errors in grammar or composition.
* 3-3.5= meeting expectations but some criteria are missing or lacking –may not always include a question to advance discussion, may not reference appropriately or follow APA, may have small grammar/compositional errors
* 1-2.5= not meeting expectations at the graduate level but made an effort
* 0 = no effort to engage in the forums

##### Lesson/Adult Learning Design 30%

Sketch out the design of one lesson or session of 3-6 hours length that will be useful to you in your work. It may be a formal lesson within an educational institution or a \(corporate\) training program.

Your design document will utilize the following organizational structure: - use titles.

###### Institutional Context \(Where?\)

###### Intents \(Why?\)

* Problem Identification
* Learner Analysis
* Learning Outcomes/Objectives
* Integration of Transformational Servant Leadership and Values Based Leadership.

###### Activities \(How?\)

###### Learning Activity \(What?\)

###### Program Sequence \(When?\)

###### Resources \(With What?\)

###### Assessment \(What was Learned?\)

Use the course textbooks to guide your thinking and structure the content within each of the above sections.

~~A draft of your learning design is to be posted on Moodle Feb. 28~~.  Peer review pairing will be given in advance.

Your peer review should be collegial and address issues like grammar and structure as well as the quality of arguments and evidence presented in the paper.  Use the rubric as a guide and give suggestions accordingly.

Please remember!

* Be Kind: Always treat others with dignity and respect. This means we never use words that are hurtful, including sarcasm.
* Be Specific: Focus on particular strengths and weaknesses, rather than making general comments like “It’s good” or “I like it.” Provide insight into why it is good or what, specifically, you like about it.
* Be Helpful: The goal is to positively contribute to the individual or the group, not to simply be heard. Echoing the thoughts of others or cleverly pointing out details that are irrelevant wastes time.
* Participate: Peer critique is a process to support each other, and your feedback is valued!
* When critiquing a peer’s work, use “I” statements. For example, “I’m confused by this part,” rather than “This part makes no sense.” 
* Use questions whenever possible. For example, “I’m curious why you chose to begin with…?”, or “Did you consider adding…?”

Remember the three important phrases:

> “I notice….”
>
> “I wonder….”
