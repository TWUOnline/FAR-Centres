Forum Discussions 20%

Online group discussions in this class are meant to be conversational though APA references for anything ‘borrowed’ is still expected.

PARTICIPATION: Each week you are required to post a reflection \(of about 3 to 4 paragraphs with references following\) to a given prompt and then, make several substantive written reply posts to others’ reflections and/or replies.

THREADING: Be careful to thread your messages properly. Please begin your post with a colleague’s name where applicable. Post below the subject to which you are responding and have the subject line accurately reflect the post. If there is not a thread up at the time you would like to post, initiate a new thread and then post below it.

CONFIDENTIALITY: Part of the value and richness of course dialogue is that learners share from their life/professional experiences to illustrate lessons they have learned. Please share discreetly and use pseudonyms when possible and necessary. Please do not share any confidential or proprietary information about your employer.

SUBSTANTIVE PARTICIPATION: We have a great opportunity to build upon one another’s knowledge, insights, and experience. Our goal is to be collaborative in the Forum. At times we will respectfully challenge each other. We anticipate that this will be a rich time of dialogue. To create a safe environment for this to take place, we must build a supportive subculture that encourages one another. Disagreeing and challenging can be stimulating if done in an edifying manner.

Substantive participation/posting may include:   
Providing a new thought, idea, or perspective;   
Citing an experience or example of what we are learning;   
Adding a new twist on a perspective;   
Critically thinking about an idea/concept;   
Questioning or challenging a principle/perspective.

What Substantive Participation is NOT:   
Very basic comments such as “I agree” or “I disagree;”   
Restating what has been said \(unless there is a direct purpose in doing so\);   
Disrespectfully disagreeing;   
Pat answers that are not thought-provoking or do not move the dialogue forward;   
Greetings/conversation better suited for the Virtual Collegium.

Below are examples of how to stimulate your own and others’ thinking:   
What would happen if...   
Other times it may be helpful to...   
It is my understanding...what is your experience with this?   
You might approach this from...   
Is it possible that...   
Would you consider...   
Maybe...   
Possibly...   
Sometimes...   
I'm wondering if...   
Do you think...

Evaluation Rubric:

The original posting is of high quality, showing depth of knowledge on the topic.  The post ends with an open-ended question to advance the discussion.  
Replies occur under two or more different threads, other than that belonging to the student. Replies are posted on more than one day during the posting period.  
Response posts to peers' original postings are respectful, show clear synthesis and evaluation of the content read, and provide depth, breath, or new insight to the topic. Reply posts stimulate thinking and advance the conversation.  
As appropriate, references are included to support what is said in both original and reply posts.  
All posts are clearly written and contain no APA/spelling/grammatical errors.  That said, a conversational tone, rather than an approach you would take in an academic paper, is perfectly fine.

4% biweekly –   
4 = outstanding depth of response; always includes a question to advance the discussion, appropriately referenced following APA, no errors in grammar or composition.   
3-3.5= meeting expectations but some criteria are missing or lacking –may not always include a question to advance discussion, may not reference appropriately or follow APA, may have small grammar/compositional errors   
1-2.5= not meeting expectations at the graduate level but made an effort   
0 = no effort to engage in the forums

Lesson/Adult Learning Design 30%

Sketch out the design of one lesson or session of 3-6 hours length that will be useful to you in your work. It may be a formal lesson within an educational institution or a \(corporate\) training program.

Your design document will utilize the following organizational structure: - use titles.

Institutional Context \(Where?\)

Intents \(Why?\)  
Problem Identification  
Learner Analysis  
Learning Outcomes/Objectives  
Integration of Transformational Servant Leadership and Values Based Leadership.

Activities \(How?\)  
Learning Activity \(What?\)  
Program Sequence \(When?\)

Resources \(With What?\)

Assessment \(What was Learned?\)

Use the course textbooks to guide your thinking and structure the content within each of the above sections.

A draft of your learning design is to be posted on Moodle Feb. 28.  Peer review pairing will be given in advance.

Your peer review should be collegial and address issues like grammar and structure as well as the quality of arguments and evidence presented in the paper.  Use the rubric as a guide and give suggestions accordingly.

Please remember!

* Be Kind: Always treat others with dignity and respect. This means we never use words that are hurtful, including sarcasm.
* Be Specific: Focus on particular strengths and weaknesses, rather than making general comments like “It’s good” or “I like it.” Provide insight into why it is good or what, specifically, you like about it.
* Be Helpful: The goal is to positively contribute to the individual or the group, not to simply be heard. Echoing the thoughts of others or cleverly pointing out details that are irrelevant wastes time.
* Participate: Peer critique is a process to support each other, and your feedback is valued!
* When critiquing a peer’s work, use “I” statements. For example, “I’m confused by this part,” rather than “This part makes no sense.” 
* Use questions whenever possible. For example, “I’m curious why you chose to begin with…?”, or “Did you consider adding…?”

Remember the three important phrases:

> “I notice….”
>
> “I wonder….”

GRADING SYSTEM  
MA Lead/MAEL Grading Rubric  
In an effort to ensure consistency in the MAL assignment of grades and to inform graduate students of assessments of the quality of work at the graduate level, the following interpretation of grades in assignments and courses offers a guideline.

Letter Grade  
%  
Grade  
Point  
Value  
Meaning in Graduate Work Note: For assignments that meet criteria in several categories, instructors will assign an average grade.   
A+  
95-100  
4.3  
Exceptionally well-reasoned, compelling development of position. Outstanding incorporation of personal vision as well as of references and resources. Strikingly appropriate examples. Extraordinary insight, critical analytical and evaluative ability, and creativity. Superlative style and language usage. Makes an original contribution and is potentially publishable.  
A  
90-94  
4.0  
Well-argued and convincing development of position. Insightful incorporation of personal vision as well as of references and resources. Notably appropriate examples. Excellent insight, critical analytic and evaluative ability, and creativity. Impressive style and language use.  
A-  
85-89  
3.7  
Thorough and plausible development of position. Skillful incorporation of personal vision as well as of references and resources. Very good examples. Very good insight, analytic and evaluative ability, and creativity. Commendable and fluent style and language usage.  
B+  
80-84  
3.3  
Proficient development of position. Appropriate incorporation of personal vision as well as of references and resources. Relevant examples. Good quality insight, analytic and evaluative ability, and creativity. Clear and correct style and language usage.  
B  
75-79  
3.0  
Competent development of position, but possibly with some gaps and/or limitations. Satisfactory incorporation of personal vision as well as of references and resources. Satisfactory examples. Reasonable insight, analytic and evaluative ability. Little creativity. Generally satisfactory style and language usage, but possibly with some minor flaws.  
B-  
70-74  
2.7\*  
Unimpressive development of position. Position not completely consistent with personal vision or references and resources not taken fully into account or examples are basic or not completely convincing or lacking acceptable insight and analytic and evaluative ability. Style and language usage with weaknesses \(e.g., clarity, coherence, grammar\). Overall quality shows noticeable deficiencies.  
C

&lt;70  
2.0  
Unacceptable work at graduate level. Shows lack of understanding and/or competence in several of the criteria described above. This grade is a failing grade at the graduate level, and students receiving a “C” course grade are required to re-take the course.  
\*Note: a grade of “B-“carries a GPA of 2.7; learners require a composite GPA of 3.0 to graduate.

Other Designated Grades  
INC = Incomplete. A grade may be incomplete if assignments remain outstanding in a course or if the instructor has not yet submitted a grade. If assignments remain outstanding at the end of a course, students must obtain and complete an incomplete grade form from Enrolment Services.  
W = Withdrew. This grade is assigned for students withdrawing during the first half of the course.  
WP /WF = Withdrew passing / Withdrew failing. These grades are assigned to students withdrawing during the second half of a course. Grades are not computed into the cumulative GPA. A student may withdraw from a course only because of severe extenuating circumstances and if approval is granted by the Program Director and the Dean of Graduate Studies.

ACADEMIC INTEGRITY AND AVOIDING PLAGIARISM AT TWU  
As scholars pursuing higher education, academic integrity is a core value of the entire TWU community. Students are invited into this scholarly culture and required to abide by the principles of sound academic scholarship at TWU. This includes, but is not limited to, avoiding all forms of plagiarism and cheating in scholarly work. TWU has a strict policy on plagiarism \(see academic calendar\). Learning what constitutes plagiarism and avoiding it is the student's responsibility. Two resources describing plagiarism and how to avoid it have been prepared by TWU Librarian William Badke and are freely available for viewing at the URLs below:  
[https://prezi.com/od62fxnkbmxh/plagiarism-how-to-get-it-out-of-your-life/](https://prezi.com/od62fxnkbmxh/plagiarism-how-to-get-it-out-of-your-life/) \(Prezi presentation\)  
[http://bit.ly/1p00KX3](http://bit.ly/1p00KX3)   \(Google Slide presentation offering more comprehensive information\)

STUDENTS WITH A DISABILITY  
Students with a disability who need assistance are encouraged to contact the Equity of Access Office upon admission to TWU to discuss their specific needs. All disabilities must be recently documented by an appropriately certified professional and include the educational impact of the disability along with recommended accommodations. Within the first two weeks of the semester, students must meet with their professors to agree on accommodations appropriate to each class. Students should follow the steps detailed by the Equity of Access Office on their website at: [http://www.twu.ca/life/wellness/learningresources/disabilities-and-equity-of-access/default.html](http://www.twu.ca/life/wellness/learningresources/disabilities-and-equity-of-access/default.html).
