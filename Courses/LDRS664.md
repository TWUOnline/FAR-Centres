### Platform Paper 30%

This is a two part assignment. Please organize your paper with subheadings according to the following.

In the first part, consider teaching, learning and context.  In this section depict your ideal adult education learning environment in all its facets. Consider student outcomes, instructional climate, instructional organization, community, personal beliefs.

In the second part,  consider the administrative or supervisory aspects of your role as an adult educator. Describe the means to realize these educational goals. In what ways will you achieve the vision? What will be your routine behaviours?

You are encouraged to write a contextualized platform grounded in your experience and to consider this as a realistic rather than hypothetical exercise.

You will write and post a draft to your blog for peer review.  Peer reviewers will be assigned in advance.
